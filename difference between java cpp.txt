difference between cpp and java

C++ is platform-dependent.

Java is platform-independent.

C++ is mainly used for system programming.
Java is mainly used for application programming.
 It is widely used in Windows-based, web-based,
 enterprise, and mobile applications.

C++ was designed for systems and applications programming. 
It was an extension of the C programming language.

Java was designed and created as an interpreter for printing systems but 
later extended as a support network computing.
 It was designed to be easy to use and accessible to a broader audience.

Java was designed and created as an interpreter

C++ supports the goto statement.

Java doesn't support the goto statement.

C++ supports multiple inheritance.

Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class.
 It can be achieved by using interfaces in java.

C++ supports operator overloading.

Java doesn't support operator overloading.

C++ supports pointers. You can write a pointer program in C++

Java supports pointer internally. However, you can't write 
the pointer program in java. 
It means java has restricted pointer support in java.

C++ uses compiler only. C++ is compiled and run using
 the compiler which converts source code into machine
 code so, C++ is platform dependent.

Java uses both compiler and interpreter. Java source
 code is converted into bytecode at compilation time. 
The interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and
 produces output. Java is interpreted that is why it is platform-independent.

C++ supports both call by value and call by reference.

Java supports call by value only. There is no call by reference in java.

C++ supports structures and unions.

Java doesn't support structures and unions

C++ doesn't support documentation comments.

Java supports documentation comment (/** ... */) to create 
documentation for java source code.

C++ supports virtual keyword so that we can decide
 whether or not to override a function.

Java has no virtual keyword. We can override all non-static 
methods by default. In other words, non-static methods
 are virtual by default.

C++ doesn't support >>> operator.

Java supports unsigned right shift >>> operator
 that fills zero at the top for the negative numbers.
 For positive numbers, it works same like >> operator.

C++ always creates a new inheritance tree.

Java always uses a single inheritance tree because 
all classes are the child of the Object class in Java.
 The Object class is the root of the inheritance tree in java.

C++ is an object-oriented language. However, in
 the C language, a single root hierarchy is not possible.

Java is also an object-oriented language. However, 
everything (except fundamental types) is an object in 
Java. It is a single root hierarchy as everything gets 
derived from java.lang.Object.

C++ provides thread support through libraries like 
POSIX threads or C++11's standard thread library.

Java has built-in support for multithreading, making
 it easy to create and manage threads.
	
C++ does not have a strict root hierarchy for classes.

Java has the "Object" class as the root of its class hierarchy.

C++ code can be closely tied to hardware and is 
often used for hardware-level programming

Java abstracts hardware access, making it less
 suitable for low-level hardware program

Applications of C++ Programming Language
System Software Development: C++ is commonly 
used for building operating systems, device drivers, 
and other system software due to its ability to interact 
closely with hardware.
 
Game Development: Many computer and console games 
are developed using C++ because of its performance 
capabilities and direct access to hardware resources.
 
Embedded Systems: C++ is favored in embedded systems 
programming for devices like microcontrollers, where 
efficiency and control over hardware are crucial.
 
Performance-Critical Applications: Applications that 
require high performance, such as real-time simulations
 and scientific computing, often use C++ for its efficiency.
 
Graphics and Multimedia: C++ is used in graphics libraries 
and multimedia applications to manage graphical elements efficiently.

Applications of Java Programming Language
Web Development: Java is widely used for building 
dynamic web applications, including server-side components, 
web services, and web-based enterprise software.
 
Mobile App Development: Java is the primary 
language for Android app development, making
 it a key choice for mobile application developers.
 
Enterprise Software: Java is commonly used in
 large-scale enterprise applications, such as 
customer relationship management (CRM) 
systems and financial software.
 
Distributed Systems: Java's platform independence 
and robust networking capabilities make it suitable for
 building distributed systems and networked applications.
 
Desktop Applications: Java Swing and JavaFX 
libraries are used to create cross-platform desktop 
applications with graphical user interfaces.
